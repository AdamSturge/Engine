Simple Open\+GL Image Library

A tiny c library for uploading images as textures into Open\+GL. Also saving and loading of images is supported.

I\textquotesingle{}m using Sean\textquotesingle{}s Tool Box image loader as a base\+: \href{http://www.nothings.org/}{\tt http\+://www.\+nothings.\+org/}

I\textquotesingle{}m upgrading it to load T\+GA and D\+DS files, and a direct path for loading D\+DS files straight into Open\+GL textures, when applicable.

Image Formats\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item B\+MP load \& save
\item T\+GA load \& save
\item D\+DS load \& save
\item P\+NG load
\item J\+PG load
\end{DoxyItemize}

Open\+GL Texture Features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item resample to power-\/of-\/two sizes
\item M\+I\+Pmap generation
\item compressed texture S3\+TC formats (if supported)
\item can pre-\/multiply alpha for you, for better compositing
\item can flip image about the y-\/axis (except pre-\/compressed D\+DS files)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Thanks to\+: Sean Barret -\/ for the awesome stb\+\_\+image Dan Venkitachalam -\/ for finding some non-\/compliant D\+DS files, and patching some explicit casts everybody at gamedev.\+net
