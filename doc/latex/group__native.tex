{\bfseries By using the native access functions you assert that you know what you\textquotesingle{}re doing and how to fix problems caused by using them. If you don\textquotesingle{}t, you shouldn\textquotesingle{}t be using them.}

Before the inclusion of \hyperlink{glfw3native_8h}{glfw3native.\+h}, you may define exactly one window system A\+PI macro and zero or more context creation A\+PI macros.

The chosen backends must match those the library was compiled for. Failure to do this will cause a link-\/time error.

The available window A\+PI macros are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+W\+I\+N32}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+C\+OA}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+X11}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+W\+A\+Y\+L\+A\+ND}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+M\+IR}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The available context A\+PI macros are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+W\+GL}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+N\+S\+GL}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+G\+LX}
\item {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+N\+A\+T\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+E\+GL}
\end{DoxyItemize}

These macros select which of the native access functions that are declared and which platform-\/specific headers to include. It is then up your (by definition platform-\/specific) code to handle which of these should be defined.
